## Citat

I **When Things Fall Apart**, berättar
Pema Chödrön historien om en ung krigare som lär sig att besegra rädslan genom att fråga rädslan själv hur det ska gå till. Och rädslan berättar hur den fungerar:

> “My weapons are that I talk fast, and I get very close to your face. Then you get completely unnerved, and you do whatever I say.
If you don’t do what I tell you, I have no power. You can listen to me, and you can have respect for me. You can even be convinced by me.
But if you don’t do what I say, I have no power.”

> "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." **- Michael Jordan,**

> “When you’re 20, you care about what everyone thinks. When you’re 40, you stop caring about what everyone thinks. When you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place.” **– Winston Churchill,**
