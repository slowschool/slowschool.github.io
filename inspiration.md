# Citat

I **When Things Fall Apart**, berättar
Pema Chödrön historien om en ung krigare som lär sig att besegra rädslan genom att fråga rädslan själv hur det ska gå till. Rädslan är helt ärlig med hur den fungerar:

> “My weapons are that I talk fast, and I get very close to your face. Then you get completely unnerved, and you do whatever I say.
If you don’t do what I tell you, I have no power. You can listen to me, and you can have respect for me. You can even be convinced by me. But if you don’t do what I say, I have no power.”

**Med andra ord, rädslan är en översittare.** En mobbare och tyrann. Den säger vad du ska göra, och när du lyder ökar dess makt.
Men om du bara lyssnar på rädslan,och struntar i vad den säger, då bygger du mod.


> "I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed." **- Michael Jordan,**

> “When you’re 20, you care about what everyone thinks. When you’re 40, you stop caring about what everyone thinks. When you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place.” **– Winston Churchill,**

## Anti-distraktion

**StayFocusd (Google Chrome)**

StayFocusd is a free Chrome add-on that stops a user-defined list of websites from loading. The extension offers a "nuclear option" that blocks all websites, when the work needs doing now, as well as a "SmartBomb" option that just blocks content like videos and pictures.

**Freedom (iPhone, iPad, Android, Mac and Windows)**

Freedom is a website blocker that runs on a wide range of platforms. The developers say it is the only distraction-blocker to work on the iPhone and iPad, and it has the ability to shut off internet access from the entire device, not just Safari. The login system means settings are shared among all devices. Perfect for staying on task.

**SelfControl**

SelfControl is a free Mac app that blocks websites from loading. Simply tell SelfControl which websites to block, set the timer, and they'll stop loading. The clever part is that the websites will stay blocked even if the computer is restarted or the app is deleted. There's no getting around it. Use it to block Facebook during essay writing, or ban YouTube during work hours.
